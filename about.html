            <p class="text">My name is Viktoriia. I am 18 years old interactive
                media designer and developer from Toronto, Ontario.
                
                
            </p>
            <p class="text-1">
                   I am studying at Fanshawe college in the Interactive
                Media Design program. I know that you will say that
                she is too young to be an experienced professional
                in interactive design and media, but in fact this is 
                not the case. I’m like a green apple it seems that it’s
                not quite ripe yet but then I open up with a sea of 
                extraordinary flavors. Just as in working with me at 
                first it may seem that I am not an experienced 
                specialist at all but in my work I open up and show 
                excellent work. 
            </p>

                 <p class="text-2">
                   I love bringing people’s vision to life. Come up with interesting and creative design
                 ideas that will eventually transform into wonderful works that will take people’s breath
                 away. In addition, I enjoy working not only with design but also with web development
                 and motion design. Motion design is my own love.
                 At the moment, I am honing my skills in this area to become a professional and work with
                 global companies.</p>
